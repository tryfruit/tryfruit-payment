  <h3>Creating a read-only API key with Braintree for added security</h3>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-7'>
  <p>For added security when using Braintree we recommend taking these steps to only grant Fruit Analytics read access to certain parts of your Braintree account.</p>

  <p>Login as admin to your Braintree account and go to Settings > Users and Roles > Manage Roles > New</p>
  <ol>
  	<li>Give the role a name like "Read only"</li>
  	<li>Uncheck all permissions except:
    	<ol>
    		<li>Download Transactions with Masked Payment Data</li>
    		<li>Download Vault Records with Masked Payment Data</li>
        <li>Download Subscription Records</li>
    	</ol>
    </li>
    <li>Now click "Create role"</li>
    <li>Now go to Settings > Users and roles > New user
      <ol>
        <li>Give the user API Access</li>
        <li>Assign the read only role and also access to the merchant accounts which you want to be included in Fruit Analytics (usually all of them)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Now logout of Braintree and log back in as this new 'read only' user</li>
    <li>Then go to Account > My User > Api Keys</li>
    <li>Use these API keys in Fruit Analytics for added security.</li>
  </ol>
